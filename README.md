# Discription about the problem statement

The objective is to make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Computer vision in predicting, minimizing, and stalling its spread of the viruses.

Hand washing is the basic step you need to follow to avoid the spread of not only COVID19 but also many other viruses.

Washing our hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

The idea is to build a deep learning model that can monitor the handwash of the user and outputs how well the user had done.

The model then can be implemented in real-time at almost everywhere including shopping malls, hospitals, police stations, quarantine spots & even at houses in the form of a web application.
